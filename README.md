# Stochastic-Simulations

At UCSB, I take classes in Stochastic Probability (at the moment, PSTAT 160B). 
These are the python scripts I write to model situations presented in homework problems. 

Each project consists of my python code with the problem included as a comment, and my response and evalutation in a .pdf file.
