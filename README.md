# Stochastic-Simulations

At UCSB, I take classes in Stochastic Probability (at the moment, PSTAT 160B). 
These are the python scripts I write to model situations presented in homework problems. 

Each project consists of the weeks homework problems in a .pdf, my python code in a .py, and my responce in a .pdf file.
